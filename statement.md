# Welcome!

This PHP template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```php runnable
<?php
 
//出力値
//3
//4
//9

$inputList = [3, 4, 9];
foreach (/*/ /*/ as $input) {
	echo $input . "\n";
}



?>
```

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced PHP template](https://tech.io/select-repo/574)
